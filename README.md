# Paper with code


This repository contains information about how to set up a GitHub repository for your research paper.
It is assumed that you need to do some analysis of data or simulations in your paper, and that the results are presented in some figures or tables.

If your paper is more a methods paper where you created a library, then you should check out the [reproducibility repo](https://github.com/scientificcomputing/reproducibility) instead.

You can read more on the documentation by going to https://scientificcomputing.github.io/paper-with-code
