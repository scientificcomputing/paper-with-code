# Data

Management of data might be tricky, both because data might be confidential or data might too large to put in a repository. It should be clear that in order to fully reproduce a study, necessary data needs to be made available.

## Raw vs processed data
We typically separate between two types of data; raw data and processed data. Here raw data can refer to data that you got from an external collaborator while processed data are typically data that has been analyzed and converted to another format.

For example, raw data could be MRI images of the heart, while processed data could be meshes that you created from those images.

## Data repository

If the data you want to share is really small in size (for example a few MB) then you could put the data directly in the repository. Otherwise you should put your data in a proper data repository. We recommend that you use [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) for this.
