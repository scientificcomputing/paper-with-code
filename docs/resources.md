# Resources

There are a few very good online guides on reproducible research.

Perhaps the most comprehensive one is [The turing way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html) from the [Alan turing institute](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute). This page contains information and guidelines about most of the things you need to know about reproducible research and we encourage everyone to skim through this site. They also have a [template repo](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/reproducible-project-template) that might be relevant.

Another relevant project is [Papers with code](https://github.com/paperswithcode) which is probably more targeted machine learning projects. The also have a pretty comprehensive guide at https://github.com/paperswithcode/releasing-research-code.

Getting inspiration from other project is often a good way. Papers with code also has a [web page](https://paperswithcode.com) where you can search for papers with code. For example you, could try to [search for FEniCS](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=FEniCS) and you will get a list of projects where FEniCS is mentioned.
