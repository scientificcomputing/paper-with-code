# Documentation

You might think that your research paper should be documentation enough. However there are several reasons to why you should also make documentation as part of your code repository. Just publishing the code itself without any guides on how to run it will make the code more or less useless, unless you are already quite skilled programmer. 

The documentation should cover at least the following:
- A high level explanation of the paper
- A link to the research paper
- A guide on how to set up the environment and how to run the code
- A license

First of all, it is nice to get a short high level introduction to what problems are solved in the paper. Second, the actual code you use is probably not documented in the paper itself so there should be some explanation about how a user can run the code and reproduce the results.

## Hosting your documentation online
While you could put all of the documentation in a README file you could also put it at a webpage, similar to the page you are reading right now. Once you have a README file it is pretty simple to turn this into a nice looking webpage using [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org) and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com).

## License

There exists a variety of different licenses. You can read more about choosing a license at https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/licensing.html
